# Carving (Chisel)

## Description

Sets a group of items any item can be converted between freely, in world and in a GUI.

:::::::::: details Warning {open id="warning"}
This compat is not fully documented. Some or all of its features are not present on the wiki. View the source code to gain an accurate understanding of the compat.
::::::::::

:::::::::: info Danger {id="danger"}
You cannot addVariation/removeVariation to chisel groups based on the oredict, you have to modify the oredict directly.
::::::::::

:::::::::: info Bug {id="bug"}
Some mods use "registry replacement" to change a preexisting entry in a registry. If this has been done to a block used by chisel, this will result in errors when manipulating *any* carving group and prevent the chiseling of that block. Of particular note is Inspirations, which can replace carpets and causes [this issue](https://github.com/Chisel-Team/Chisel/issues/828).
